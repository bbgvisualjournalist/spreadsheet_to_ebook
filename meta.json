    "description": "趙紫陽在上個世紀八十年代擔任過國家總理和中共的總書記，是中國改革開放初期最重要的領導人之一。他在1989年那場學運期間因和鄧小平發生根本分歧而下台，之後被軟禁在家，失去了自由。本書不僅記錄了趙紫陽生命中最後16年的生活狀況和情緒變化，也描述了他在這個階段對中共和中國前途進行深刻思考的心路歷程。趙紫陽對他的繼任者和中共主要人物的評價尤為入木三分，對人們了解那個時代中共內部的人和事會有重要的幫助。",
    "descriptionenglish": "Zhao Ziyang, China’s premier and the General Secretary of Chinese Communist Party in 80s, was one of the most important figures in China’s modern history being called “era of reforms and opening up” (改革開放)。 He had lived in house arrest since he parted with his mentor Deng Xiaoping in 1989 on how to deal with students’ demonstrations for democracy and against corruption. This book records not just the real life of his 16 years in house arrest, but also the significant changes in his views on the future of China and the party,  his rarely-known comments on his successors, and the revelation of his inner thoughts on what ruined Deng’s trust in him. \n",

    "description": "上個世紀五十年代中共軍隊佔領西藏以後，西藏政府與北京曾經有過一段美好的時光，雙方簽訂了正式的協議，西藏精神領袖達賴喇嘛還到北京會見了毛澤東等中共領袖，氣氛融洽、親切。但到了1959年，雙方突然刀兵相見，出現了流血衝突，直至發生了大規模的戰爭，達賴喇嘛等逃往印度。導致這一重大歷史變化的原因是什麼？本書根據對西藏問題專家的採訪從多方面回顧和分析了雙邊關係惡化的一系列事件和促使達賴喇嘛出走的原因，使那些被迷霧籠罩、塵封已久的歷史呈現出不曾為人注意的邏輯線條。",
    "descriptionenglish": "In the beginning of the 50s of last century, Beijing and Tibet had a short period of peaceful and friendly ties following the occupation of Tibet by the troops of the communist party of China. However, in 1959, the good days suddenly ended with bloody frictions developing into a large-scale war, highlighted by the escape of Dalai Lama into India. This book, based on interviews with Tibet historians, examines those events that played some roles in the abrupt change of Beijing-Tibet ties, and those key factors that contribute to Dalai Lama’s determination to leave.

    "description": "本書是《達賴喇嘛出走始末》的下集，通過挖掘史實和專家分析回答了中國官方長期以來在“拉薩事件”起因和達賴喇嘛出走問題上提出的一些主要說法，比如，藏人決定“獨立”在前，流血衝突在後；中共對解決西藏問題是有誠意的，動武是迫不得已的選擇；中共與西藏簽訂《十七條協議》反映了北京的誠意等等。本書還通過一些間接的證據，比如鄧小平的信、阿沛·阿旺晉美的信等揭示了中共武力解決西藏問題的真實意圖。此外，美國中央情報局的作用以及“拉薩事件”究竟是一場戰爭還是一場屠殺等人們存有誤解的問題，本書都有比較詳盡的說明。",
    "descriptionenglish": "This is the second part of the book “The Escape of Dalai Lama”. By presenting ample historical evidences and the analysis by historians, it offers a new perspective to look at a number of major factors affecting the directions of history, such as “Lhasa Incident”, the logic behind the use of force by the communist troops, the motivations of the “Seventeen Point Agreement”, where the dominant interpretations in China place blame on Dalai Lama and Tibetan authorities, and emphasizes the passive nature of Beijing’s resorting to military force to solve the Tibet issue. The book also sheds some light on the murky role of CIA in “Lhasa Incident”, and reveals the cruelty of the so-called “suppression of Tibet insurgency”.",

The book also discloses the details of the secret contact with Chiang of general Fu Zuoyi and Song Qingling, widow of Sun Yat-sen, both served as high-ranking officials unde Mao.    ",
